# Challenge-One
UT Coding Bootcamp HTML, CSS, Git Challenge One

# Code Refactor Starter Code


# Goal
- Change Codebase to follow accessibility standards without changing the function of the code

# Acceptance Criteria

1. Use semantic HTML elements when available
    -Changed the div sections to their respective semantic tags
            -Nav
            -content
            -section
            -footer
            -aside

2. elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    -elements were give their own distinctive boxes and sections to separate content
    -some elements were given classes so they are independent of their positioning
    -some classeses were removed so the css woudld simply address certain sections (i.e. footer class was just turned into the footer section)

3. add accessible alt attributes to images
    -all images have their own alt attribute for accessibility

4. heading attributes should be in order
    -heading attributes seem to already be in order, no overlapping headers are found (i.e. h1 > h2 > h1)

5. concise and descriptive title to webpage
    -changed titlt from "webpage" to "Horiseon" the name of the webpage instead
